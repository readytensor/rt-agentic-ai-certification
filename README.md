## Program Overview

The Agentic AI Developer Certification Program is a hands-on, 12-week journey into building intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative AI systems. Designed by Ready Tensor, the program blends practical instruction with real-world project work to help you master the tools, techniques, and thinking needed to build agentic systems that reason, plan, and take action.

You’ll move beyond basic prompt engineering and chatbot interfaces to design goal-driven agents using frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, work with vector databases and RAG pipelines, and build systems that are production-grade and portfolio-ready.

---

## Program Structure: Modules & Weekly Flow

This program is structured into **three comprehensive modules**, each culminating in a practical, portfolio-worthy project:

- **Module 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundations of Agentic AI**  
  Explore core concepts including agent architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use. You'll build your first project — a question-answering assistant powered by RAG.

- **Module 2 (Weeks 5–8): Architecting Multi-Agent Workflows**  
  Build collaborative, tool-using agentic AI systems. In this module, you’ll design dynamic agents, implement multi-agent workflows, and integrate external tools using protocols like MCP. Your project will showcase a working multi-agent system that solves a real problem through coordination and orchestration.

- **Module 3 (Weeks 9–12): Real-World Readiness**  
  Learn to test, secure, deploy, and monitor your agentic systems using guardrails, observability, and lightweight hosting. You’ll wrap up the program with a production-aware, portfolio-ready capstone project.

---

## Project-Based Certification

Each module ends with a hands-on project that demonstrates your understanding of key concepts — from building RAG assistants to multi-agent systems to production-ready applications.

To earn certification, participants must complete and submit all three projects on the Ready Tensor platform. Each project is evaluated independently, and submissions must meet the scoring threshold to qualify for certification.

Successful participants will receive:

- A **certificate** for each module and a final **Agentic AI Developer Certificate**
- **Digital badges** to showcase on LinkedIn and your Ready Tensor profile

Projects are designed to be portfolio-worthy and reflect real-world skills.
