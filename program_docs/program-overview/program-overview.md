Welcome to the **Agentic AI Developer Certification Program** by Ready Tensor! This is a **100% FREE** 12-week, hands-on learning journey where you'll design, build, and deploy intelligent, goal-driven AI systems.

--DIVIDER--

# What You'll Learn

This program is structured into three comprehensive modules, each culminating in a practical, portfolio-worthy project:

- **Module 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Foundations of Agentic AI**
  Explore core concepts including agent architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use. You'll build your first project‚Äîa question-answering assistant.

- **Module 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): Architecting Agentic Workflows**
  Build collaborative, tool-using AI systems. In this module, you‚Äôll design dynamic agents, implement multi-agent workflows, and integrate external tools using protocols like MCP. Your project will showcase a working multi-agent system that solves a real problem through coordination and orchestration.

- **Module 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Real-World Readiness**
  Learn to test, secure, deploy, and monitor your agentic systems with guardrails, logging, and lightweight hosting. Finish with a production-grade, portfolio-ready final project.

# What You‚Äôll Earn

Participants who successfully complete the program will receive:

## üèÜ Certificates of Completion

You‚Äôll earn **one certificate for each module** upon completing its associated project. After completing all three modules and meeting the program requirements, you‚Äôll receive a **final certificate** recognizing your full certification as an **Agentic AI Developer**.

## üéñÔ∏è Digital Badges

In addition to certificates, you‚Äôll receive **four digital badges**‚Äîone for each module and one for completing the full program. These badges will be displayed on your **Ready Tensor profile page** and can be used to showcase your achievements on LinkedIn or other professional platforms.

> _Badges and certificates signal real-world, project-based competency in agentic AI systems._

# How the Program Works

This 12-week program is divided into three modules, each lasting four weeks. Each module culminates in a hands-on project that you will build and submit. Each week follows a consistent and engaging format:

- **Weekly Lessons**: Essential readings, publications, and templates provided weekly to deepen your understanding and guide your projects. Some lessons include videos with quizzes, expert commentary, and code walkthroughs.
- **Community Engagement**: Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/EsVfxNdUTR) for ongoing discussions, community Q\&A, and team collaboration.
- **Project Submissions**: You‚Äôll submit three main projects, one per module, individually or as part of a team (max 5 people).
- **Project Reviews**: Each project is reviewed independently, so you can complete and submit modules at your own pace. Your submission will be evaluated in the next available cohort based on when you submit (see **Monthly Cohorts and Rolling Submissions** section below).
- **Free Certification**: The certification program is completely free. All participants who complete the requirements for all 3 projects will receive an official **Agentic AI Developer Certificate**.
