Welcome to the **Agentic AI Developer Certification Program** by Ready Tensor! This is a **100% FREE** 12-week, hands-on learning journey where you'll design, build, and deploy intelligent, goal-driven AI systems.

--DIVIDER--

# What You'll Learn

This program is structured into three comprehensive modules, each culminating in a practical, portfolio-worthy project:

- **Module 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Foundations of Agentic AI**
  Explore core concepts including agent architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use. You'll build your first project‚Äîa question-answering assistant.

- **Module 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): Architecting Multi-Agent Systems**
  Build collaborative, tool-using agentic AI systems. In this module, you‚Äôll design dynamic agents, implement multi-agent workflows, and integrate external tools using protocols like MCP. Your project will showcase a working multi-agent system that solves a real problem through coordination and orchestration.

- **Module 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Real-World Readiness**
  Learn to test, secure, deploy, and monitor your agentic systems with guardrails, logging, and lightweight hosting. Finish with a production-grade, portfolio-ready final project.

# What You‚Äôll Earn

Complete the program and earn credentials that prove your hands-on expertise:

## üèÜ Certificates of Completion

You‚Äôll earn **one certificate for each module** upon completing its associated project. After completing all three modules and meeting the program requirements, you‚Äôll receive a **final certificate** recognizing your full certification as an **Agentic AI Developer**.

## üéñÔ∏è Digital Badges

In addition to certificates, you‚Äôll receive **four digital badges**‚Äîone for each module and one for completing the full program. These badges will be displayed on your **Ready Tensor profile page** and can be used to showcase your achievements on LinkedIn or other professional platforms.

> _Badges and certificates signal real-world, project-based competency in agentic AI systems._

<h2> üëá Sample Certificate and Badge </h2>

![main-certificate-and-badge-module.jpg](main-certificate-and-badge-module.jpg)

## üíº Real-World Portfolio Projects

Every certified project you complete is published on the Ready Tensor platform ‚Äî with documentation, code links, and a dedicated project page. These are professional-grade deliverables that you can share with employers, collaborators, and the broader AI community.

> Your certification is more than a badge ‚Äî it‚Äôs backed by public proof of work.

---

# Expert Review and Feedback

When you submit your project, it‚Äôs not a one-shot pass/fail exam. Each submission is **independently reviewed by an expert**, with detailed feedback on what works, what can be improved, and how to level up your solution.

You‚Äôre encouraged to iterate, refine your project, and **resubmit based on feedback** ‚Äî just like in real-world AI development.

--DIVIDER--

# Micro-Certifications & Program Flexibility

This program is fully modular ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to follow the learning modules and lessons in order. If you already have experience with RAG, for example, you can jump straight into Module 2 and complete that project first.

Each module leads to an independent **micro-certificate** and badge:

- üß† **Module 1 ‚Äì RAG Systems Expert**
- ü§ñ **Module 2 ‚Äì Agentic AI Builder**
- üîí **Module 3 ‚Äì Agentic AI Engineer**

You'll receive a certificate and digital badge upon completing each module‚Äôs project and meeting the requirements.

<h2> üéì Earn the Full Certification </h2>

To become a fully certified **Agentic AI Expert**, you must:

- Complete and submit all three module projects
- Meet the 70% score threshold for each
- Publish each project on the Ready Tensor platform with code and documentation

This earns you:

- ‚úÖ All three micro-certificates
- ‚úÖ The official **Agentic AI Developer Certificate**
- ‚úÖ The ‚ÄúAgentic AI Expert‚Äù badge ‚Äî displayed on your profile and sharable on LinkedIn

# How the Program Works

This 12-week program is structured into three modules, each designed to take about four weeks ‚Äî but you're free to move faster or slower based on your schedule. Each module culminates in a hands-on project that can be completed at your own pace and submitted whenever you're ready for review.

Here‚Äôs how the program is structured:

- **Learning Materials**: Lessons, code templates, and publications are organized by week to give structure ‚Äî but everything is available upfront. Some lessons include walkthrough videos, quizzes, and expert commentary to guide your learning.

- **Community Engagement**: Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/EsVfxNdUTR) for ongoing discussions, community Q\&A, team formation, and support.

- **Project Submissions**: You‚Äôll submit three main projects (one per module), either individually or as part of a team (max 5 people). You can submit projects in any order.

- **Expert Reviews**: Each project is reviewed independently. You‚Äôll be evaluated in the next available review cycle based on your submission date (see **Project Submission & Evaluation Timeline** below).

- **Free Certification**: The certification program is completely free. You‚Äôll earn a certificate for each completed module, and the **Agentic AI Developer Certificate** when all three are complete.

# Project Submission & Evaluation Timeline

This program is flexible ‚Äî you can start anytime and move through the modules at your own pace.

To help manage project reviews, we evaluate submissions in **monthly review cycles**.

If you submit a project by one of the deadlines below, it will be reviewed in that month‚Äôs cycle. If you miss a deadline, no problem ‚Äî your project will be evaluated in the next one.

<h2> üìÖ Upcoming Evaluation Deadlines  </h2>

| Submission Deadline | Review Period Begins |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| August 8, 2025      | August 9, 2025       |
| September 5, 2025   | September 6, 2025    |

| November 7, 2025    | November 8, 2025     |

> ‚úÖ You can submit **any module‚Äôs project** in any order. Submit one, two, or all three ‚Äî your progress is tracked independently.

<h2>üîç Example </h2>

If you submit your project on **August 22**, it will be included in the **September 6 review cycle** (based on the September 5 deadline). If you miss that, it rolls forward to the next one.
