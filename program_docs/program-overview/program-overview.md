 <!-- RT_DIVIDER -->

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Developer Certification Program** by Ready Tensor! This is a **100% FREE** 12-week, hands-on learning journey where you'll design, build, and deploy intelligent, goal-driven AI systems.

 <!-- RT_DIVIDER -->

# What You'll Learn

This program is structured into three comprehensive modules, each culminating in a practical, portfolio-worthy project:

- **Module 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Foundations of Agentic AI**
  Explore core concepts including agent architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use. You'll build your first project‚Äîa question-answering assistant.

- **Module 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): Architecting Multi-Agent Systems**
  Build collaborative, tool-using agentic AI systems. In this module, you‚Äôll design dynamic agents, implement multi-agent workflows, and integrate external tools using protocols like MCP. Your project will showcase a working multi-agent system that solves a real problem through coordination and orchestration.

- **Module 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Real-World Readiness**
  Learn to test, secure, deploy, and monitor your agentic systems with guardrails, logging, and lightweight hosting. Finish with a production-grade, portfolio-ready final project.

 # How the Program Works
 
 The **Agentic AI Developer Certification Program** is organized into **three modules**, each designed to take about four weeks.  
 - **Each module ends with a hands-on project** ‚Äî your primary goal for that module.  
 - Successfully completing a module‚Äôs project earns you a **micro-certificate** for that module.  
 - Complete all three modules to earn the **full Agentic AI Developer Certificate**.
 
 ## Flexible Pace to Fit Your Schedule  
 The program is designed for a 12-week pace, but you‚Äôre free to move faster. Highly motivated participants ‚Äî especially those with prior experience ‚Äî often complete a module in as little as a week. You control your learning speed, and there are no penalties for finishing early or taking longer.
 
 ## Your Focus: Complete the 3 Projects  
 While lessons are valuable learning resources, the main objective is to **successfully deliver the three projects**. These projects demonstrate your ability to design, build, and deploy agentic AI systems ‚Äî and they‚Äôre what you‚Äôll be evaluated on.
 
 ## Learning Materials  
 All lessons, videos, publications, and code templates are provided up front so you can learn at your own pace. Lessons are there to **support your project work** ‚Äî not as rigid prerequisites ‚Äî and may include:  
 - Walkthrough videos  
 - Expert commentary  
 - Quizzes for self-check  
 - Reference code repositories
 
 ## Community Engagement  
 Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/EsVfxNdUTR) for ongoing discussions, Q&A, team formation, and peer support.
 
 ## Project Submissions & Reviews  
 - You‚Äôll submit **three main projects** ‚Äî one per module ‚Äî either individually or in a team (up to 5 people).  
 - Projects can be submitted in any order.  
 - Each project is reviewed independently, and your submission will be evaluated in the **next available review cycle** based on its submission date (see **Project Submission & Evaluation Timeline**).  
 
 ## Cost & Certification  
 The program is completely free. You‚Äôll earn:  
 - **One micro-certificate** for each successfully completed module.  
 - The **Agentic AI Developer Certificate** upon successful completion of all three modules.

 # Expert Review and Feedback
 
 When you submit your project, it‚Äôs not a one-shot pass/fail exam. Each submission is **independently reviewed by an expert**, with detailed feedback on what works, what can be improved, and how to level up your solution.
 
 You‚Äôre encouraged to iterate, refine your project, and **resubmit based on feedback** ‚Äî just like in real-world AI development.

 # Micro-Certifications & Program Flexibility
 
 This program is fully modular ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to follow the learning modules and lessons in order. If you already have experience with RAG, for example, you can jump straight into Module 2 and complete that project first.
 
 Each module leads to an independent **micro-certificate** and badge:
 
 - üß† **Module 1 ‚Äì RAG Systems Expert**
 - ü§ñ **Module 2 ‚Äì Agentic AI Builder**
 - üîí **Module 3 ‚Äì Agentic AI Engineer**
 
 You'll receive a certificate and digital badge upon completing each module‚Äôs project and meeting the requirements.
 
 <h2> üéì Earn the Full Certification </h2>
 
 To become a fully certified **Agentic AI Expert**, you must:
 
 - Complete and submit all three module projects
 - Meet the 70% score threshold for each
 - Publish each project on the Ready Tensor platform with code and documentation
 
 This earns you:
 
 - ‚úÖ All three micro-certificates
 - ‚úÖ The official **Agentic AI Developer Certificate**
 - ‚úÖ The ‚ÄúAgentic AI Expert‚Äù badge ‚Äî displayed on your profile and sharable on LinkedIn

 # Project Submission & Evaluation Timeline
 
 This program is flexible ‚Äî you can start anytime and move through the modules at your own pace.
 
 To help manage project reviews, we evaluate submissions in **monthly review cycles**.
 
 If you submit a project by one of the deadlines below, it will be reviewed in that month‚Äôs cycle. If you miss a deadline, no problem ‚Äî your project will be evaluated in the next one.
 
 <h2> üìÖ Upcoming Evaluation Deadlines  </h2>
 
 | Submission Deadline | Review Period Begins |
 | ------------------- | -------------------- |
 | August 11, 2025      | August 12, 2025       |

 <!-- RT_DIVIDER -->
 :::info{title="Info"}
 
 <h2>Missed Project Deadline? No Problem</h2>
 
 If you miss one of the listed submission deadlines, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî your project can still be submitted at any time. It will simply roll forward into the next monthly review cycle.
 
 You won‚Äôt lose your work, your progress, or your eligibility. Every project is tracked independently.
