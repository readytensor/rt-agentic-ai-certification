# 👋 Meet the Instructor & Program Creators

You’ll be learning from **Abhyuday Desai, Ph.D.**, the founder of Ready Tensor. He’s led AI/ML teams across industries for 20 years and now he’s here to guide you through the program.

You’ll also meet the amazing team that brought this program to life: Victory (our curriculum lead), and a crew of AI/ML engineers who’ve supported everything from content development to tool/template creation and community outreach.

🎥 **Watch this video** to hear about the people behind AAIDC, their backgrounds, and why they care deeply about this program.

# 💡 Why We Created This Program

This program was born from demand. After launching our global Agentic AI competition and seeing 700+ incredible submissions, we heard one question over and over:

> “How do I actually get started with Agentic AI?”

We created this program to answer that question, and to invite you to help build the very tools we're working on ourselves.

🎥 **Watch this video** to learn what inspired the program and how it fits into our broader vision at Ready Tensor.

# 📚 What You’ll Learn

This program is structured into three modules over 12 weeks:

Module 1 – Foundational concepts of agentic AI

Module 2 – Building agentic AI systems

Module 3 – Production-readiness and deployment

🎥 Watch this video for three key takeaways that will help you understand what this program is really about - beyond just the syllabus.

## 🎓 Certification Pathways: Start Anywhere, Build Toward the Full Credential

This program is designed to be flexible — you can start with any module that matches your interest or experience.

Each module is independently certifiable. Complete its project and you'll earn a **micro-certificate**:

- 🧠 Module 1 – **RAG Systems Expert**
- 🤖 Module 2 – **Agentic AI Builder**
- 🔒 Module 3 – **Agentic AI Engineer**

When you complete all three modules, you'll unlock the **full program certificate** and earn the official title of **Agentic AI Expert** — along with a special badge on your profile.

> Already know how to build with RAG? Skip ahead to Module 2. Prefer to focus on deployment? Start with Module 3. Just make sure to complete all three to earn the full credential.

### ✅ Submitting Existing Work

Already built a project that aligns with one of the modules? You can submit it — as long as it meets the certification requirements.

For example, if you’ve previously built a RAG-powered chatbot or a multi-agent planner, you may be eligible for a Module 1 or 2 certificate. Just review the project requirements for the corresponding modules and ensure your submission includes:

- Required components outlined in the module brief
- Clean, documented code
- A well-written Ready Tensor project publication

> Your project doesn’t have to be new — it just has to meet the bar.

# 🛠️ How the Program Works (And How to Get the Most Out of It)

This isn’t a lecture-first course. It’s a build-first program — designed to mirror how real-world AI projects actually get done.

You’re not here to memorize theory. You’re here to **build**, with guidance, examples, and tools to support you along the way.

## All Lessons Are Available Upfront

All lessons across all 12 weeks are already unlocked. You can explore any topic, at any time — whether you're moving ahead early or circling back for a refresher.

New lessons, updates, and improvements are added regularly based on feedback and evolving best practices. You’ll always have access to the latest material.

---

## How the Learning Works

Each week is structured around a mix of:

- 📘 **Lessons** that explain concepts clearly and practically
- 🛠️ **Code examples and templates** to help you apply what you learn
- 🎥 **Videos** with expert commentary, walkthroughs, and explanations

The goal is to help you go from reading → to understanding → to building.

You don’t have to follow a strict sequence — treat this like a flexible toolkit. Start with the project, then pull in what you need to get the job done.

---

## Our Recommended Approach

- Start with the **project description** for the module
- Finalize your idea and your team (3–4 people is ideal, solo is okay too)
- Make a rough plan and divide the work
- Use the materials to fill your knowledge gaps
- Focus on building something real — not just watching or reading

# ✅ That’s It for Orientation

You now have a sense of what this program is, who’s behind it, and how to get started.

Head over to Module 1 when you’re ready, and begin exploring the first project.

If you have questions along the way, the Discord community is a great place to ask and connect.

Let’s get to work.
